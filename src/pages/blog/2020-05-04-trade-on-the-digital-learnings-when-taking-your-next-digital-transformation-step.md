First, we went into chock and forced ourselves to use digital tools to meet and being a remote worker. By now, most of you have discovered the benefits with digital tools and most likely passed some of the mental barriers that you had initially. These new experiences should really be taken care of when you and your company take the next step in your digital transformation.

In IDG’s recent study, it is obvious that almost half of the companies have made no significant progress when it comes to their digital transformation. Could be organizational or motivation barriers, legacy roadblocks or maybe lack of investment budget. Whatever the reason is, I think occurring Corona crisis can provide you with advantages that can push your next step.   

Some areas you can dig deeper in:

1. **Leverage the team’s ability to change
   **

The social distancing forced most teams to work from home. It forced people to learn and use digital tools, but it also fostered a new behavior in many ways. For some team members, the safe office-based framework disappeared, which caused frustration and the loss of business focus. For others, it was a boost to discover new ways of working. By now, you have most likely seen everyone’s living room, or even bedroom and said hi to at least one family member. You have met your colleges without their business clothes, without make-up and you have most likely talked about more personal things than even before. All these small things have strengthened the team and you have proved you managed the dramatic change and you survived, with more learnings as a result. What is team ready to take on next?

2. **The digital customer relationship continues
   **

The majority of traditional customer meetings has turned digital. Some companies have even chosen to run digital conferences or seminars for their customers. Most likely you have discovered the time-win here, thanks to more effective meetings and no travel. Can your customer accept you continue to make business in the digital way? Can you image how much time and carbon footprint you can save?

3. **Plan your next step in Digital transformation now**

Review your situation here. Is your digital transformation strategy still relevant or can you trade on the learnings and the new experiences from the spring? In times of crisis, it is always important to repeat your vision and look ahead. Communicate the hope! By moving the focus to your next step, you not only motivate your team but also plant that focus into the whole team or even company. Have you experience efficiencies you can make as standard? Have you started to explore new tools? Have your customer provided you with new insights that can improve your product or service experience. If you just let go of the crisis-mindset for a few minutes, you will be able to look ahead and the opportunities arises.
